## üç¥ What is Forking?

### üß† Concept

**Forking** is the process of **copying someone else's repository** from GitHub into **your own GitHub account**.

> This lets you make changes freely **without affecting the original project**.

### üîß Why Fork?

‚úÖ Contribute to open source projects  
‚úÖ Experiment with the project safely  
‚úÖ Submit improvements or bug fixes  
‚úÖ Maintain your own version of a project

### üî® How to Fork a Repository

1. Go to a GitHub repo.
    
2. Click the **"Fork"** button (top-right).
    
3. GitHub creates a copy under your username.
    

You now have full control over the forked repo.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone Your Fork

After forking, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

## üîÉ Keep Fork Up to Date (Optional)

To sync your fork with the original repo:

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
