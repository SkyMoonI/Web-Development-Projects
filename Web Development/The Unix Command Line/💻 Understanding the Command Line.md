### 🧠 What Is the Command Line?

The **command line** (or **terminal**) is a text-based interface that lets you interact directly with your computer's operating system.

Instead of clicking on icons, you **type commands** to navigate, manage files, run programs, and automate tasks.

✅ Common on **Unix-based systems** (Linux, macOS), but available on Windows via tools like **Git Bash**, **WSL**, or **PowerShell**.

- 🧩 **Control**: Direct access to system processes and files.
    
- 🧰 **Essential**: Required for tools like Git, Node.js, Python, Docker, and deployment.
    
- 💼 **Industry Standard**: Used daily by developers, sysadmins, and DevOps engineers.

### 🖥️ CLI vs GUI

|Feature|Command Line (CLI)|Graphical Interface (GUI)|
|---|---|---|
|Speed|Fast|Slower|
|Learning Curve|Steep|Easier|
|Power|High|Limited|
|Automation|Easy with scripts|Hard|

### 🏁 Starting the Terminal

- On **macOS**: Open **Terminal** app.
    
- On **Linux**: Use Ctrl+Alt+T or open your distro's terminal.
    
- On **Windows**: Use **Git Bash**, **CMD**, or **WSL (Ubuntu)**.

### 🔧 Basic Prompt Anatomy

```bash
user@computer:~/folder$ 
```

- `user` – Your username
    
- `computer` – Your machine name
    
- `~/folder` – Current working directory
    
- `$` – Indicates a user prompt (`#` means root)

### 🧠 Tip: The Shell

The command line runs inside a **shell**. Common shells include:

- `bash` – Bourne Again SHell (default in many systems)
    
- `zsh` – Z Shell (popular with Oh-My-Zsh)
    
- `fish` – Friendly Interactive SHell (user-friendly alternative)
